# Python Password Manager and File Encryption/Decryption App

![Password Manager Logo](icon.ico)

This is a Python password manager and file encryption/decryption app that provides a secure way to manage your credentials and encrypt/decrypt files using three layers of protection: hashing, encryption, and storage.

## Features

1. **Password Management**
   - Add, view, edit, and delete credentials securely.
   - Hashed passwords are stored to ensure enhanced security.

2. **File Encryption/Decryption**
   - Encrypt and decrypt all types of files, including images, videos, and more.
   - Files are securely encrypted before being stored.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imlogeshmohan/Password-Manager.git
cd password-manager
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `data/files` directory and place the files you want to encrypt in this folder.

2. To run the app, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to manage your credentials or encrypt/decrypt files.

## Security

The password manager utilizes three layers of protection to ensure the security of your data:

1. **Hashing**: User passwords are hashed and encryped before storage using a strong cryptographic hashing algorithm. This ensures that passwords are never stored in plain text, providing an additional layer of security.

2. **Encryption**: All files placed in the `data/files` directory are encrypted using a secure encryption algorithm before being stored in the app. This ensures that your sensitive files remain protected.

3. **Storage**: Encrypted passwords and files are securely stored in the `data` folder. Ensure that you keep this folder protected and back up your data regularly to prevent data loss.
